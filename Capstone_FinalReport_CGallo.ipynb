The city experiences four distinct seasons, with considerable variance in length. As a result of the rapid passage of weather systems the weather is variable from day to day in all seasons. Toronto encompasses a geographical area formerly administered by many separate municipalities. These municipalities have each developed a distinct history and identity over the years, and their names remain in common use among Torontonians."

Besides, sinde acording to the data (2017) Italian is placed in the top 20 of ethnic origins in this city with almost 7% of the total population, it would be a great business idea to start a restaurant in certian neigborhoods that provide a higher profit."

Ihad the chance to analyze information from different data sources and use the Foursquare API to meet the proposed objective. After this project, the idea of a real analysis becomes much clearer since it involves a lot of information that although it may contain errors, it can lead us to obtain very accurate results. It simply remains to deepen these analyzes since they are very useful when solving everyday problems."
